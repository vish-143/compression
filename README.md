## Compression Project in C
This project implements compression techniques specifically for text files, based on existing algorithms. It includes two different methods:

- Huffman Algorithm: A straightforward implementation of the standard Huffman algorithm, which can reduce text file sizes by nearly 50%.
- Modified LZ77 Technique: A slightly modified version of the LZ77 algorithm, which also achieves up to 50% reduction in text file size.
