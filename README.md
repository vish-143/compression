# compression project in c
there are different compression techniques for different type of data.
compression implemented in this project is is for  text files.
It is based on existing compression algorithm.
Two different algorithms are implemented in this project
First one is straight implementation of standard Huffman algorithm.
Second one is little modified LZ77 technique.
Huffman implementation reduces text file size by almost 50% .
LZ77 technique also reduces size upto 50%  .
